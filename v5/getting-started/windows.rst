Installing on Windows
=====================

.. note:: 
   The recommended method for installing PROS on all platforms is now using our
   VS Code extension. Instructions for this can be found on the :doc:`./index`
   page.
   
   If you do not want to use VS Code, the method below will allow you to install
   the old, deprecated fork of Atom we call the PROS Editor or the CLI by iteslf.
   
   If you are an advanced user looking to install the PROS CLI through Python pip,
   check out the instructions on the :doc:`./linux` page instead.

To start using PROS 3 on Windows, simply download the latest version of the
installer (.exe file) from `here <https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli3/releases/latest/>`_.
You do not need to download any other files.

.. note::
   Make sure that you download the correct version of the installer for your computer
   (32- or 64-bit). You will run into problems if you use the wrong one. To determine
   what type of operating system you are using, go to Windows' :code:`Settings>System>About`
   and next to :code:`System type` it will either say :code:`64-bit operating system` or :code:`32-bit operating system`.
