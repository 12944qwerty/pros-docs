Installing on Windows
=====================

To start using PROS 3 on Windows, simply download the latest version of the installer (.exe file) from `here <https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli3/releases/latest/>`_. You do not need to download any other files.

.. note::
   Make sure that you download the correct version of the installer for your computer
   (32- or 64-bit). You will run into problems if you use the wrong one. To determine
   what type of operating system you are using, go to Windows' :code:`Settings>System>About`
   and next to :code:`System type` it will either say :code:`64-bit operating system` or :code:`32-bit operating system`.
